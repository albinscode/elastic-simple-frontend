In particular, words with umlauts are not hyphenated\n%%% often anyhow, even with the `multiple-word' approach from |german.sty|.\n\n%%% \\item{---} It is typographic usage that between compound words\n%%% ligatures are not built. Plain~\\TeX{} has no easy, readable way to\n%%% provide this.\n\n%%% \\noindent This file does the according definitions. They are quite\n%%% often only a kludge. But it is hard to make the restrictions\n%%% disappear, sometimes it is even impossible within the current\n%%% implementation of \\TeX{}---and there will never be any other\n%%% implementation. So we must live with these kludges.\n\n\n%%% \\sect Of course, there is more to German typesetting.  Hyphenation,\n%%% also for words with umlauts and sharp~s, etc.  This basic\n%%% functionality is supplied by the \\babel{} system and DANTE's\n%%% |german.sty|, we have to load the appropriate module.\n\n%%% There's one problem, though. \\babel{}~3.5 defines\n%%% |\\DeclareTextSymbol|, a symbol used by |german.sty| to decide if it\n%%% shall use NFSS code to access symbols. But that usage will lead to an\n%%% endless recursion, because some text symbols are defined by\n%%% themselves. I don't know if that problem is caused by \\babel{}'s code\n%%% or by its usage in |german.sty| -- turning it off seems to be an\n%%% appropriate fix.\n\n%%% \\beginprog\n\\let\\DeclareTextSymbol\\undefined\n\\input german.sty\n%%% \\endprog\n\n\n%%% \\sect But before we start we declare some shorthands for category\n%%% codes. By declaring the at sign~(`|@|') as well as the\n%%% underscore~`(|_|)' as letters we can use them in our macros. (I\n%%% agree with D.~Knuth that |\\identifier_several_words_long| is more\n%%% readable than |\\IdentifierSeveralWordsLong| and in every case better\n%%% than |\\p@@@s|.) With the at sign we can use the ``private'' Plain\n%%% macros and with the underscore we can make our own macros more\n%%% readable. But as we have to restore these category codes at the end\n%%% of this macro file we store their former values in control\n%%% sequences. This method is better than to use\n%%% a group because not all macros have to be defined global this way.\n\n%%% \\beginprog\n\\ifx \\CatEscape\\undefined\n    \\chardef\\CatEscape=0\n    \\chardef\\CatOpen=1\n    \\chardef\\CatClose=2\n    \\chardef\\CatIgnore=9\n    \\chardef\\CatLetter=11\n    \\chardef\\CatOther=12\n    \\chardef\\CatActive=13               % \\active of plain.tex\n    \\chardef\\CatInvalid=15\n\n    \\chardef\\CatAtCode=\\catcode`\\@\n    \\chardef\\CatUsCode=\\catcode`\\_\n\\fi\n\n\\catcode`\\@=\\CatLetter                  % top level macro file\n\\catcode`\\_=\\CatLetter\n%%% \\endprog\n\n\n%%% \\sect Let's identify this macro file against the user and in the Log file.\n\n%%% \\beginprog\n\\begingroup\n    \\catcode`\\$=\\CatIgnore\n    \\catcode`\\:=\\CatIgnore\n    \\message{Support for German documents, $Revision: 1.4 $}\n\\endgroup\n%%% \\endprog\n\n\n\n%%% \\chap National Characters.\n\n%%% By default no extended characters are available, except those defined\n%%% below.

Knuth’s Computer\nModern fonts are very elegant but sometimes we all look for a change. Many of\nus want to typeset TEX documents in fonts other than Computer Modern. At the\n\nuser level, changing the font in TEX’s text mode, i.e. the text font, is simple and there are many\nfree fonts available with various typefaces like roman, bold, italic, slanted, italic bold, slanted\nbold, CAPS, BOLD CAPS, etc. The difficulty lies in changing the math fonts in TEX documents. This\nis mainly due to the lack of math fonts for TEX. Another reason is that switching the font in math\nmode is not as simple as switching the font in text mode. For LATEX there are various packages that\ncan be used to change the font — text and math — with one statement. But for TEX, I could not find\nan easy way to change the font in the document — text and math. Using one font in text mode\nand another in math mode can spoil the look of the document. It is always desired to have text\nand math in the same font; text in New Century and math in Computer Modern do not go well.\nThough there are some combinations, as we will see later, that go well.\n\nBeing able to choose from different fonts is quite advantageous. Computer Modern fonts look\nvery good on paper, esp. on inkjet printouts, but they look relatively thin on new computer screens\n(LCDs) and on laser printouts. For slide shows, most people prefer sans-serif fonts of relatively\nheavier weight. The idea of changing the entire font family which includes various typefaces like\nboldface, italics, etc., and the math fonts, with one control statement has been the motivation be-\nhind my work. For this purpose I have written 45 TEX macros that instruct TEX to typeset documents\nin the fonts called by those macros. In this document, the use of the above mentioned 45 font\nmacros has been displayed. Each of these macros changes the fonts in the document globally, and\ncan be used locally too, i.e. within a group. Now a TEX document, which is normally produced\nin Computer Modern, can be produced in 45 other font variants. These macro files can be easily\nunderstood, and changed if convenient. Each macro has various typefaces declared at 5, 6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 pt sizes.\n\nTo display our 45 font changing macros in action, a sample text has been typeset 45 times\nbut in different fonts. The fonts/font families called by our macros have almost all the glyphs con-\ntained in the Computer Modern family. In general, these fonts have more glyphs than Computer\nModern. To see all the glyphs in a font, please use Werner Lemberg’s fontchart utility. In a few\ncases, e.g., in Epigrafica normal font (epigrafican8r), some important glyphs like Γ and Θ are\nmissing. Our macro takes care of this; the user need not bother unless something very unusual is\ndemanded from TEX.\n\nUsage\nThese macros have been bundled as a package called font-change which is included in MiKTEX and\nTEX Live distributions. The package can also be downloaded from CTAN. If our TEX installation has\nthe package font-change installed then we can readily use it, e.g., to typeset our document in\nCharter, we have to type \\input font_charter in our source file. Of course, in order to use any of\nthe macros of font-change, our TEX installation should have the required fonts. In case we do not\nhave font-change installed on our TEX system and we are lazy to install it, then we can download\n\n1 Typographically, the correct expression is, “TEX typesets documents in Computer Modern typefaces by default.” But\nmost people (including me) use the words font and typeface synonymously. In this manual such distinction has been\navoided.\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.tex.ac.uk/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/fontchart.html\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/font-change/\n\n\nthe package from the internet and follow the following procedure. Please read the following to\nknow about the available options and to see the macros in effect.\n\nSuppose we would like to typeset our TEX document in Charter font. To do this we have to copy\nthe TEX macro file font_charter.tex to the directory (folder) which contains our TEX source file.\nIn our TEX source file, we have to type \\input font_charter. This will change the font to Charter\nfrom the point where the statement \\input font_charter was declared. We can declare \\input\nfont_charter in a closed group ({\\input font_charter ... }) to change the font to Charter in\nthat group, provided no other font change is called in that group or its sub-group.\n\nAnother way to use the font changing macro files is to put them in a folder (say “font-change”)\nin some drive (say “C”) and then call these files in our TEX source file. If we want to use the Charter\nfont, we should type \\input C:/font-change/font_charter to get the desired change. If we have\nput the font changing macro files in a folder that has space(s) in its name (say “font change”),\nthen we should type \\input \"C:/font change/font_charter\" to use the Charter font.\n\nThe complete change of font will be at the default size in TEX (10 pt), though a little manip-\nulation with the macro file will enable us to use the text and math fonts at smaller and larger\npoint changes.\n\nThe basic typeface changing TEX control statements\n\n\\rm . . . roman\n\\it . . . italic\n\\bf . . . boldface\n\\sl . . . slanted\n\\tt . . . typewriter\n\nhold their usual meaning. All the macro files that this PDF mentions have the above mentioned\nfive options. In addition, most macro files have other useful options too. These are:\n\n\\itbf . . . italic boldface\n\\slbf . . . slanted boldface\n\\caps . . . CAPS\n\\capsbf . . . CAPS IN BOLDFACE\n\nIn the text mode, the above mentioned typefaces can be used at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16,\n18, and 20 pt sizes. This is done by typing the size in words between the backslash (\\) and the\nwords that declare the typeface. For example, if we want to typeset some text in bold at 14 pt then\nwe have to use the control statement \\fourteenbf.\n\n2\n\n\n\nExample\nA sample TEX source file as shown below:\n\n\\parindent=0pt\n\n\\input C:/font-change/font_cm\n\nThis is the {\\bf Computer Modern font}. The {\\twelveslbf Gamma function\\/}\n\nis defined as:\n\n$$\\Gamma(z) \\equiv \\int_0ˆ\\infty tˆ{z-1} eˆ{-t} dt.$$\n\n\\input C:/font-change/font_charter\n\nThis is the {\\bf Charter font}. The {\\twelveslbf Gamma function\\/}\n\nis defined as:\n\n$$\\Gamma(z) \\equiv \\int_0ˆ\\infty tˆ{z-1} eˆ{-t} dt.$$\n\n{ % begin group\n\n\\input C:/font-change/font_century\n\nThis is the {\\bf New Century Schoolbook font}. The {\\twelveslbf Gamma\n\nfunction\\/} is defined as:\n\n$$\\Gamma(z) \\equiv \\int_0ˆ\\infty tˆ{z-1} eˆ{-t} dt.$$\n\n} % end group\n\nNow we are back to Charter.\n\nafter compilation will produce:\n\nThis is the Computer Modern font. The Gamma function is defined as:\n\nΓ(z) ≡\n∫ ∞\n0\n\ntz−1e−tdt.\n\nThis is the Charter font. The Gamma function is defined as:\n\nΓ(z)≡\n∫ ∞\n\n0\n\ntz−1e−t dt.\n\nThis is the New Century font. The Gamma function is defined as:\n\nΓ(z) ≡\n∫ ∞\n\n0\ntz−1e−tdt.\n\nNow we are back to Charter.\n\n3\n\n\n\nAMS Symbols\n\nSome fonts, e.g., Kp-Fonts, have support for AMS symbols. Fonts msam and msbm of the AMS font\ncollection contain these symbols. Blackboard letters (A,B,C,R, . . . ) are a part of AMS symbols.\nIf we are using AMS-TEX, and we are using the preprint style or we have already declared \\Use-\nAMSsymbols (default AMS-TEX command), then we can use AMS symbols with some of the macros of\nfont-change by declaring \\UseAMSsymbols again after calling the macro. In a while we will look\nat an example of this implementation.\n\nIf we have used instructions \\loadmsam or \\loadmsbm of AMS-TEX, we can use the statements\nagain after declaring the font-change macro to obtain the desired results. The control sequence\n\\UseAMSsymbols subsumes the instructions \\loadmsam and \\loadmsbm.\n\nIf we would like to return to the default AMS fonts — msam and msbm— we will have to input\nthe macro file default-amssymbols.tex by instructing \\input default-amssymbols in our source\nfile. This small file has just the following two defintions:\n\n\\def\\loadmsam{\\font\\tenmsa=msam10 \\font\\sevenmsa=msam7 \\font\\fivemsa=msam5\n\n\\fam\\msafam\n\n\\textfont\\msafam=\\tenmsa \\scriptfont\\msafam=\\sevenmsa\n\n\\scriptscriptfont\\msafam=\\fivemsa \\global\\let\\loadmsam\\empty}%\n\n\\loadmsam\n\n%\n\n\\def\\loadmsbm{\\font\\tenmsb=msbm10 \\font\\sevenmsb=msbm7 \\font\\fivemsb=msbm5\n\n\\fam\\msbfam\n\n\\textfont\\msbfam=\\tenmsb \\scriptfont\\msbfam=\\sevenmsb\n\n\\scriptscriptfont\\msbfam=\\fivemsb \\global\\let\\loadmsbm\\empty}%\n\n\\loadmsbm\n\nIt will be mentioned further if a macro of package font-change offers AMS symbols support.\nThe following shows the discussed in action (the character in red color is from AMS symbols):\n\n\\input amstex % Input AmSTeX\n\n\\UseAMSsymbols % Calls AMS symbols\n\n$$f:{\\color{red}\\Bbb R}ˆ3\\to R$$\n\n\\input font_kp % Call Kp-Fonts\n\n\\UseAMSsymbols % Uses jkpsya and jkpsyb of Kp-Fonts instead of msam and msbm of AMS\n\nfonts\n\n$$f:{\\color{red}\\Bbb R}\\to R$$\n\n\\input default-amssymbols % Return to default\n\n$$f:{\\color{red}\\Bbb R}ˆ3\\to R$$\n\n4\n\n\n\nupon compilation produces:\n\nf : R3 → R\n\nf : R3 → R\n\nf : R3 → R\n\nAvailable Weights\nSome font changing macros of the package font-change offer light, medium, and bold weights.\nThere are many font families that offer the bold weight variant of the math fonts, but we have\nnot all included such variants as they do not supply a heavier font to produce the contrast. If\nwe type all text in boldface then at places where we would like to get bolder we are be left\nwithout an option. The philosophy of font-change says that to use bold for all text and math\nwe need a heavier typeface available within the type family, which is heavier than the usual bold.\nFont families Kp-Fonts, Antykwa Toruńska, Iwona, and Kurier include such weights and they have\nbeen included in font-change. For instance, macro font_kurier-bold, which uses boldface as the\nnormal font (in math and text), uses the heavy weight font as the boldface.\n\nChanges and warning\nThe fonts used in these 45 macros are included in MiKTEX and TEX Live distributions. All these mac-\nros should work smoothly with a full installation of MiKTEX (version 2.9.4503 tested). The macros\nshould work smoothly with TEX Live 2014 too, but TEX Live 2013 does not contain the recent font\nupdates, due to which many macros from the new version of font-change might not work with\nTEX Live 2013 or earlier. But this should not be a big issue as the installation disk of TEX Live 2013 con-\ntains the older version of font-change, which has older font names. Many macros of font-change\nuse inconsolata font as the typewriter font. The font was rm-inconsolata in version 2010.1 of\nfont-change. The new version of inconsolata, which has been updated in MiKTEX 2.9.4503, does\nnot contain any font named rm-inconsolata. Therefore in font-change (version 2013.1), we have\nchosen another inconsolata font called ly1-zi4r-1, which is the same or at least looks just the\nsame like rm-inconsolata. Some other changes in names of fonts have been too, e.g. in Libertine\nfonts. If the user, who has a complete installation of MiKTEX or TeXLive, is encountered with missing\nfont issues when using font-change, then it is recommended to use an older or newer version of\nfont-change.\n\nThese 45 font changing macros have worked successfully with plain TEX, and a combination\nof plain TEX and other formats based on plain TEX, e.g., AMS-TEX and eplain. The macros work\nsmoothly with pdfTEX and X ETEX too. Please note that these macros do not work with LATEX, pdfLATEX,\nor X ELATEX.\n\nIf we are typesetting our document in English with any mathematics, then using these macros\nshould be trouble free. They might demur when we try to type letters like ł, esp. when using\ntypefaces like slanted boldface or CAPS. These are issues of missing glyphs and encoding.

To make the font chang-\ning macro files more consistent, both italics and slanted commands, e.g., \\it and \\sl, produce\nslanted typefaces in case of sans-serif fonts and in those fonts that do not have distinct italic and\nslanted glyphs.

Of course, the value of\nthe meaning and purpose of text, which holds even if sentences have been scribbled, is beyond\ncomparison, but it is good to arrange good text in a good way. This part of our discussion deals\nwith two salient features of typeset text arrangement — inter-line and inter-word spacing.\n\nIf the text font in TEX is changed, the inter-line and inter-word spacing is not changed accord-\ningly. This is not such a problem if we declare the new font at the same size as the preceding one.\nBut if the new font is declared at a considerably larger or smaller size, the typesetting might not\nbe aesthetically elegant.\n\nWe deal with the inter-line and inter-word spacing problem first-hand by starting with an ex-\nample. Then an “acceptable” solution to the spacing problem has been elaborated. The solution is\nnot perfect but it is handy and a passable compromise. Then we move towards theoretical aspects\nof spacing. The discussion is fairly brief and can act as a good starting point for re-evaluating the\n“space problem”. When it comes to word spacing, the best guide is our own experience. If we try\nto justify text (12 pt) in triple columns on an A4 page, then we are likely to face some problems.\nNarrower the column, sterner the justification. We will not deliberate on microtypography — a\ndistinctive approach that devotes much to spacing issues and can be used with pdfTEX. Curious\nreaders are referred to these three works: [1], [2], and [3].\n\nExample\nA sample TEX source file as shown below:\n\n\\parindent=0pt\n\n\\input font_epigrafica_euler % the font size is 10pt\n\nInter-line and inter-word spacing are very important parameters of\n\ntypesetting.

But most people (including me) use the words {\\eightit font\\/} and {\\eightit typeface\\/} synonymously. In this manual such distinction has been avoided.} Knuth's Computer Modern fonts are very elegant but sometimes we all look for a change. Many of us want to typeset \\capstex\\ documents in fonts other than Computer Modern. At the user level, changing the font in \\capstex's {\\sl text mode}, i.e.\\ the text font, is simple and there are many free fonts available with various typefaces like {\\rm roman}, {\\bf bold}, {\\it italic}, {\\sl slanted}, {\\itbf italic bold}, {\\slbf slanted bold}, {\\caps Caps}, {\\capsbf Bold Caps}, etc. The difficulty lies in changing the math fonts in \\capstex\\ documents. This is mainly due to the lack of math fonts for \\capstex. Another reason is that switching the font in {\\sl math mode\\/} is not as simple as switching the font in {\\sl text mode}. For \\capslatex\\ there are various packages that can be used to change the font\\emdash text and math\\emdash with one statement. But for \\capstex, I could not find an easy way to change the font in the document\\emdash text and math. Using one font in {\\sl text mode\\/} and another in {\\sl math mode\\/} can spoil the look of the document. It is always desired to have text and math in the same font; text in New Century and math in Computer Modern do not go well. Though there are some combinations, as we will see later, that go well.\n\nBeing able to choose from different fonts is quite advantageous. Computer Modern fonts look very good on paper, esp.\\ on inkjet printouts, but they look relatively thin on new computer screens (LCDs) and on laser printouts. For slide shows, most people prefer sans-serif fonts of relatively heavier weight. The idea of changing the entire font family which includes various typefaces like boldface, italics, etc., and the math fonts, with one control statement has been the motivation behind my work. For this purpose I have written 45~\\capstex\\ macros that instruct \\capstex\\ to typeset documents in the fonts called by those macros. In this document, the use of the above mentioned 45~font macros has been displayed. Each of these macros changes the fonts in the document globally, and can be used locally too, i.e.\\ within a group. Now a \\capstex\\ document, which is normally produced in Computer Modern, can be produced in 45 other font variants. These macro files can be easily understood, and changed if convenient. Each macro has various typefaces declared at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20\\,pt~sizes.\n\nTo display our 45~font changing macros in action, a sample text has been typeset 45 times but in different fonts. The fonts/font~families called by our macros have almost all the glyphs contained in the Computer Modern family. In general, these fonts have more glyphs than Computer Modern. To see all the glyphs in a font, please use Werner Lemberg's \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/fontchart.html}{fontchart}~utility. In a few cases, e.g., in Epigrafica normal font~(\\verbatim epigrafican8r|endverbatim), some important glyphs like $\\Gamma$ and~$\\Theta$ are missing. Our macro takes care of this; the user need not bother unless something very unusual is demanded from~\\capstex.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Usage}These macros have been bundled as a package called  {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} which is included in {\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex\\ and \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}} distributions. The package can also be downloaded from \\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/font-change/}{\\caps ctan}. If our \\capstex\\ installation has the package {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} installed then we can readily use it, e.g., to typeset our document in Charter, we have to type {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim} in our source file. Of course, in order to use any of the macros of font-change, our \\capstex\\ installation should have the required fonts. In case we do not have {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} installed on our \\capstex\\ system and we are lazy to install it, then we can download the package from the internet and follow the following procedure. Please read the following to know about the available options and to see the macros in~effect.\n\nSuppose we would like to typeset our \\capstex\\ document in Charter font. To do this we have to copy the \\capstex\\ macro file {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font_charter.tex|endverbatim} to the directory~(folder) which contains our \\capstex\\ source file. In our \\capstex\\ source file, we have to type {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim}. This will change the font to Charter from the point where the statement {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim} was declared. We can declare {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim} in a closed group ({\\color{brown}\\verbatim {\\input font_charter ... }|endverbatim}) to change the font to Charter in that group, provided no other font change is called in that group or its~sub-group.\n\nAnother way to use the font changing macro files is to put them in a folder (say ``font-change\") in some drive~(say ``C'') and then call these files in our \\capstex\\ source file. If we want to use the Charter font, we should type {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input C:/font-change/font_charter|endverbatim} to get the desired change. If we have put the font changing macro files in a folder that has space(s) in its name~(say ``font change''), then we should type {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input \"C:/font change/font_charter\"|endverbatim} to use the Charter font.\n\nThe complete change of font will be at the default size in \\capstex\\ (10\\,pt), though a little manipulation with the macro file will enable us to use the text and math fonts at smaller and larger point~changes.\n\n\\goodbreak The basic typeface changing \\capstex\\ control statements\\sk\n{\\obeylines\\leftskip1cm\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\rm|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\rm roman}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\it|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\it italic}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\bf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\bf boldface}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\sl|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\sl slanted}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\tt|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\tt typewriter}\n\\leftskip0cm}\\sk\n\n\\ii hold their usual meaning. All the macro files that this {\\caps pdf} mentions have the above mentioned five options. In addition, most macro files have other useful options too. These~are:\\sk\n{\\obeylines\\leftskip1cm\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\itbf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\itbf italic boldface}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\slbf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\slbf slanted boldface}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\caps|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\caps Caps}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\capsbf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\capsbf Caps in Boldface}\n\\leftskip0cm}\\ms\n\nIn the {\\sl text mode}, the above mentioned typefaces can be used at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20\\,pt~sizes. This is done by typing the size in words between the backslash~($\\backslash$) and the words that declare the typeface. For example, if we want to typeset some text in bold at~14\\,pt then we have to use the control statement {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\fourteenbf|endverbatim}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\\subsection{Example}A sample \\capstex\\ source file as shown below:\n\n\\bigskip\\hrule\\vbox{\\noindent\\vrule\\NoBlackBoxes\\vbox{\\vskip2mm\\leftskip7mm\\rightskip7mm\n{\\obeylines\\parindent=0pt\\color{brown}\\verbatim\n\\parindent=0pt\n\\input C:/font-change/font_cm\nThis is the {\\bf Computer Modern font}.

Fonts {\\verbatim msam|endverbatim} and {\\verbatim msbm|endverbatim} of the {\\caps ams} font collection contain these symbols. Blackboard letters~($\\Bbb A, \\Bbb B, \\Bbb C, \\Bbb R, \\dots$) are a part of {\\caps ams} symbols. If we are using \\amstex, and we are using the preprint style or we have already declared {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\UseAMSsymbols|endverbatim} (default \\amstex\\ command), then we can use {\\caps ams} symbols with some of the macros of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} by declaring {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\UseAMSsymbols|endverbatim} {\\bf again} after calling the macro. In a while we will look at an example of this implementation.\n\nIf we have used instructions {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\loadmsam|endverbatim} or {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\loadmsbm|endverbatim} of \\amstex, we can use the statements {\\bf again} after declaring the {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} macro to obtain the desired results. The control sequence {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\UseAMSsymbols|endverbatim} subsumes the instructions {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\loadmsam|endverbatim} and {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\loadmsbm|endverbatim}.\n\nIf we would like to return to the default {\\caps ams} fonts\\emdash {\\verbatim msam|endverbatim} and {\\verbatim msbm|endverbatim}\\emdash we will have to input the macro file {\\color{brown}\\verbatim default-amssymbols.tex|endverbatim} by instructing {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input default-amssymbols|endverbatim} in our source file. This small file has just the following two defintions:\n\n\n\\bigskip\\hrule\\vbox{\\noindent\\vrule\\NoBlackBoxes\\vbox{\\vskip2mm\\leftskip7mm\\rightskip7mm\n{\\obeylines\\parindent=0pt\\color{brown}\\verbatim\n\\def\\loadmsam{\\font\\tenmsa=msam10 \\font\\sevenmsa=msam7 \\font\\fivemsa=msam5\n\\fam\\msafam\n\\textfont\\msafam=\\tenmsa \\scriptfont\\msafam=\\sevenmsa\n\\scriptscriptfont\\msafam=\\fivemsa \\global\\let\\loadmsam\\empty}%\n\\loadmsam\n%\n\\def\\loadmsbm{\\font\\tenmsb=msbm10 \\font\\sevenmsb=msbm7 \\font\\fivemsb=msbm5\n\\fam\\msbfam\n\\textfont\\msbfam=\\tenmsb \\scriptfont\\msbfam=\\sevenmsb\n\\scriptscriptfont\\msbfam=\\fivemsb \\global\\let\\loadmsbm\\empty}%\n\\loadmsbm\n|endverbatim}\n\\vskip2mm}\\vrule}\\hrule\\BlackBoxes\\bigskip\n\nIt will be mentioned further if a macro of package {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} offers {\\caps ams} symbols support.

There are many font families that offer the bold weight variant of the math fonts, but we have not all included such variants as they do not supply a heavier font to produce the contrast. If we type all text in boldface then at places where we would like to get bolder we are be left without an option. The philosophy of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} says that to use bold for all text and math we need a heavier typeface available within the type family, which is heavier than the usual bold. Font families Kp-Fonts, Antykwa Toru\\'nska, Iwona, and Kurier include such weights and they have been included in {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}. For instance, macro {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font_kurier-bold|endverbatim}, which uses boldface as the normal font~(in math and text), uses the heavy weight font as the~boldface.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Changes and warning}The fonts used in these 45 macros are included in \\href{http://miktex.org/}{{\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex} and \\href{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}} distributions. All these mac\\-ros should work smoothly with a full installation of {{\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex} (version 2.9.4503 tested). The macros should work smoothly with \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}~2014 too, but \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}~2013 does not contain the recent font updates, due to which many macros from the new version of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} might not work with \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}} 2013 or earlier. But this should not be a big issue as the installation disk of \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}} 2013 contains the older version of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}, which has older font names. Many macros of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} use {\\verbatim inconsolata|endverbatim} font as the typewriter font. The font was {\\verbatim rm-inconsolata|endverbatim} in version 2010.1 of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}. The new version of {\\verbatim inconsolata|endverbatim}, which has been updated in {\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex}~2.9.4503, does not contain any font named {\\verbatim rm-inconsolata|endverbatim}. Therefore in {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}~(version 2013.1), we have chosen another {\\verbatim inconsolata|endverbatim} font called {\\verbatim ly1-zi4r-1|endverbatim}, which is the same or at least looks just the same like {\\verbatim rm-inconsolata|endverbatim}. Some other changes in names of fonts have been too, e.g. in Libertine fonts. If the user, who has a complete installation of {{\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex} or TeXLive, is encountered with missing font issues when using {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}, then it is recommended to use an older or newer version of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}.\n\n\\footline{\\centerline{\\foliofont\\folio}}\n\n\nThese 45~font changing macros have worked successfully with plain~\\capstex, and a combination of plain~\\capstex\\ and other formats based on plain~\\capstex, e.g.,  \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/amstex.html}{\\amstex} and~\\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/eplain.html}{eplain}. The macros work smoothly with \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pdftex.html}{pdf\\capstex} and \\href{http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex}{\\capsxetex} too. Please note that these macros do not work with \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/latex.html}{\\capslatex}, pdf\\capslatex\\hfuzz2pt, or \\capsxelatex.\n\n\\hfuzz1pt\nIf we are typesetting our document in English with any mathematics, then using these macros should be trouble free. They might demur when we try to type letters like \\l, esp.\\ when using typefaces like {\\slbf slanted boldface\\/} or {\\caps Caps}. These are issues of missing glyphs and encoding. In the current typeface (Charter, regular roman, {\\verbatim mdbchr7t|endverbatim}), {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\l|endverbatim} produces \\l, {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\slbf \\l|endverbatim} produces {\\slbf \\l}, but {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\caps\\l|endverbatim} produces~{\\caps \\l}.\n\n\n\n\n\nSans-serif fonts do not have {\\it italics}\\emdash they only have {\\sl slanted\\/} glyphs. To make the font changing macro files more consistent, both italics and slanted commands, e.g., {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\it|endverbatim} and {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\sl|endverbatim}, produce {\\sl slanted} typefaces in case of sans-serif fonts and in those fonts that do not have distinct italic and slanted glyphs. Displayed further are samples exhibiting the change of \\capstex's text and math fonts using macros of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}. All the fonts used in any macro of {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} are also listed in this~document.\n\nIt is hoped that these macros work well and do not raise compatibility issues but it can not be promised. There is no warranty. If the user find any bugs, or has suggestions or complaints, please email them to~me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%   Macros   %%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\\section{\\sixteenbf\\fontss Charter}{Charter}\n\\sample\n\\ii The Charter font is declared by typing {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\input font_charter|endverbatim}.

Dans ce manuel nous avons \\'evit\\'e ces distinctions.} Les polices Computer Modern de Knuth sont tr\\`es \\'el\\'egantes mais de temps \\`a autre nous cherchons tous un peu de changement. Bon nombre d'entre nous souhaiterait avoir un rendu de nos documents \\capstex\\ dans d'autres fontes que Computer Modern. Au niveau utilisateur, il est ais\\'e de changer la police du {\\sl mode texte} de \\capstex\\ (autrement dit la police texte), et il existe de nombreuses polices gratuites aux multiples styles de caract\\`eres tels que {\\rm romain}, {\\bf gras}, {\\it italique}, {\\sl pench\\'e}, {\\itbf gras italique}, {\\slbf gras pench\\'e}, {\\caps petites capitales}, {\\capsbf petites capitales en gras}, etc. La difficult\\'e est de changer les polices math\\'ematiques dans les documents \\capstex\\. Ceci est principalement d\\^u au manque de fontes math\\'ematiques pour \\capstex. Une autre raison est que changer de police en {\\sl mode maths\\/} n'est pas aussi simple que de la changer en {\\sl mode texte}. Pour \\capslatex\\, beaucoup de packages peuvent servir \\`a changer la police (texte et math) en une commande. Mais pour \\capstex, je n'ai pas pu trouver de mani\\`ere simple pour changer la fonte dans le document, \\`a la fois pour le texte et l'\\'ecriture math\\'ematique. Le fait d'utiliser une police en {\\sl mode texte\\/} et une autre en {\\sl mode maths\\/} peut g\\^acher le rendu du document. Il est bien s\\^ur d\\'esirable d'obtenir le texte et les \\'ecritures math\\'ematiques dans la m\\^eme police; un texte en police New Century et des maths en Computer Modern ne vont pas bien ensemble. Certaines combinaisons, comme nous le verrons plus loin, marchent pourtant bien.\n\nEtre en mesure de choisir entre plusieurs fontes est plut\\^ot avantageux. Les polices Computer Modern rendent tr\\`es bien sur papier, particuli\\`erement sur les impressions jet d'encre, mais ont l'air relativement fines sur les \\'ecrans d'ordinateurs (LCD) et dans une moindre mesure sur les impressions laser. Pour les diaporamas, la plupart des gens pr\\'ef\\`ere les caract\\`eres sans s\\'erif qui sont relativement plus ``lourds''. L'id\\'ee de changer, en une seule commande, \\`a la fois les polices math\\'ematiques et la totalit\\'e d'une famille de polices qui comprend des styles vari\\'es comme le gras, l'italique, etc., a engendr\\'e la motivation n\\'ecessaire \\`a l'accomplissement de cette t\\^ache. Pour ce faire, j'ai \\'ecrit 45~macros \\capstex\\ qui ordonnent \\`a \\capstex\\ de typographier les documents dans les polices appel\\'ees par ces macros. Tout au long de ce document, l'utilisation des 45 macros mentionn\\'ees a \\'et\\'e expos\\'ee. Chacune de ces macros change les fontes dans le document de mani\\`ere globale, mais peut \\'egalement \\^etre utilis\\'ee localement, par exemple \\`a l'int\\'erieur d'un groupe. D\\'esormais, un document \\capstex, normalement produit en Computer Modern, peut \\^etre produit en 45 autres variantes. Ces fichiers macro sont facilement compr\\'ehensibles et peuvent \\^etre modifi\\'es si besoin. Chaque macro a diff\\'erents caract\\`eres d\\'eclar\\'es en tailles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, et 20\\,pt.\n\nAfin de montrer nos 45~macros de changement de fonte en action, nous avons \\'ecrit un texte \\'echantillon 45 fois mais dans des polices diff\\'erentes. Les polices/familles de police invoqu\\'ees par ces macros ont presque tous les glyphes contenus dans la famille Computer Modern. En g\\'en\\'eral, ces polices contiennent plus de glyphes que Computer Modern. Pour voir tous les glyphes pr\\'esents dans une police, vous pouvez utiliser \\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontchart?lang=en}{l'outil en ligne} de Werner Lemberg. Dans quelques cas, par exemple pour la police Epigrafica normal~(\\verbatim epigrafican8r|endverbatim), il manque des symboles importants comme $\\Gamma$ and~$\\Theta$. Notre macro prend cela en charge; l'utilisateur ne doit pas s'en soucier \\`a moins qu'il ne demande \\`a~\\capstex\\ quelque chose de tr\\`es inhabituel.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Utilisation}{Utilisation}Ces macros ont \\'et\\'e rassembl\\'ees dans un package appel\\'e {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} qui est inclus dans les distributions {\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex\\ et \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}. Le package peut aussi \\^etre t\\'el\\'echarg\\'e sur \\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/font-change/}{\\caps ctan}. Si l'installation \\capstex\\ contient d\\'ej\\`a le package {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}, il peut \\^etre utilis\\'e d\\`es \\`a pr\\'esent, pour mettre en forme n'importe quel document en police Charter par exemple. Il suffit d'\\'ecrire la commande {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim} dans le fichier source. Bien s\\^ur, pour pouvoir utiliser les macros de font-change, l'installation \\capstex\\ doit contenir les polices en question. Au cas o\\`u {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} n'est pas install\\'e sur le syst\\`eme de l'utilisateur et celui-ci n'a pas envie de le faire, on peut t\\'el\\'echarger le package sur internet et suivre la proc\\'edure ci-dessous. Pour conna\\^\\i tre toutes les options disponibles et voir les macros en action, veuillez lire la suite.\n\nSupposons qu'on veuille typographier un document \\capstex\\ document en police Charter. Pour ce faire, il faut copier le fichier macro \\capstex\\ {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font_charter.tex|endverbatim} dans le dossier contenant le fichier source \\capstex\\. Apr\\`es avoir ouvert ce fichier source dans l'\\'editeur, il faudra y \\'ecrire la commande {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim}. Ceci changera la police du document en police Charter \\`a partir de l'endroit o\\`u la commande {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim} a \\'et\\'e d\\'eclar\\'ee. Il est possible de d\\'eclarer {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input font_charter|endverbatim} dans un groupe ferm\\'e~: ({\\color{brown}\\verbatim {\\input font_charter ... }|endverbatim}) afin de changer la police de caract\\`eres en Charter dans tout le groupe, pourvu qu'il n'y ait pas d'autre appel \\`a font-change dans ce groupe ou dans un de ses sous-groupes.\n\nUne autre mani\\`ere d'utiliser les fichiers macros est de les mettre dans un dossier, nomm\\'e par exemple ``font-change'', dans un endroit du disque (par exemple \\`a la racine de ``C''), et ensuite d'invoquer ces fichiers dans le fichier source \\capstex\\. Pour utiliser la police Charter, il faudra \\'ecrire la commande suivante (qui pr\\'ecise juste la localisation du fichier dans l'arborescence syst\\`eme) {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input C:/font-change/font_charter|endverbatim}. Si les fichiers macros ont \\'et\\'e plac\\'es dans un dossier dont le nom contient des espaces (par exemple ``font change''), il faudra alors \\'ecrire naturellement la commande avec les espaces correspondants~: {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\input \"C:/font change/font_charter\"|endverbatim}.\n\nLe changement complet de la police se fera \\`a la taille \\capstex\\ par d\\'efaut, \\`a savoir (10\\,pt), bien que l'on puisse utiliser les polices texte et maths \\`a des tailles plus petites et plus grandes via de petites manipulations du fichier macro.\n\n\\goodbreak Les commandes de contr\\^ole typographique \\capstex\\ basiques \\sk\n{\\obeylines\\leftskip1cm\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\rm|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\rm romain}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\it|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\it italique}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\bf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\bf gras}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\sl|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\sl pench\\'e}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\tt|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\tt machine \\`a \\'ecrire}\n\\leftskip0cm}\\sk\n\n\\ii gardent leur signification habituelle. Tous les fichiers macro que ce {\\caps pdf} mentionne incluent les cinq options ci-dessus. De plus, la plupart des fichiers macro ont \\'egalement d'autres options utiles. Ce sont:\\sk\n{\\obeylines\\leftskip1cm\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\itbf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\itbf gras italique}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\slbf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\slbf gras pench\\'e}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\caps|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\caps petites capitales}\n{\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\capsbf|endverbatim} \\dots  {\\capsbf petites capitales en gras}\n\\leftskip0cm}\\ms\n\nEn {\\sl mode texte}, les styles mentionn\\'es ci-dessus peuvent \\^etre utilis\\'es en taille 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, et 20\\,pt. Ceci est obtenu en tapant la taille (nombre en anglais) en toutes lettres entre un backslash~($\\backslash$) et le mot qui d\\'eclare le style de caract\\`eres \\`a utiliser. Par exemple, si nous voulions typographier un texte en gras \\`a~14\\,pt nous n'aurions qu'\\`a utiliser la commande de contr\\^ole suivante {\\color{brown}\\verbatim \\fourteenbf|endverbatim}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\\subsection{Exemple}{Exemple}Voici un exemple de fichier source \\capstex~:\n\n\\bigskip\\hrule\\vbox{\\noindent\\vrule\\NoBlackBoxes\\vbox{\\vskip2mm\\leftskip7mm\\rightskip7mm\n{\\obeylines\\parindent=0pt\\color{brown}\\verbatim\n\\parindent=0pt\n\\input C:/font-change/font_cm\nVoici la {\\bf police Computer Modern}.

Les polices {\\verbatim msam|endverbatim} et {\\verbatim msbm|endverbatim} de la collection {\\caps ams} contiennent ces symboles. Les lettres ajour\\'ees~($\\Bbb A, \\Bbb B, \\Bbb C, \\Bbb R, \\dots$) font partie des symboles {\\caps ams}.

De nombreuses familles de police offrent la variante grasse des fontes math\\'ematiques, mais nous n'avons pas toujours inclus certaines variantes qui ne fournissaient pas une police assez \\'epaisse pour rendre le contraste. En tapant tout le texte en gras, si \\`a certains endroits nous voulons mettre encore plus de gras, nous serons coinc\\'es. La philosophie de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} dit que pour mettre en gras tout le texte et les maths, il faut trouver une police plus \\'epaisse parmi la famille de polices utilis\\'ee, encore plus grasse que le gras habituel. Les familles de fontes Kp-Fonts, Antykwa Toru\\'nska, Iwona, et Kurier incluent de telles \\'epaisseurs et font partie de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}. Par exemple, la macro {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font_kurier-bold|endverbatim}, qui utilise un style gras pour sa police normale (en maths et texte), prend une police poids lourd pour le style gras.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Mises \\`a jour et avertissement}{Mises a jour et avertissement}Les polices utilis\\'ees dans ces 45 macros sont incluses dans  les distributions \\href{http://miktex.org/}{{\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex} et \\href{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}}. Toutes ces macros devraient marcher sans probl\\`eme avec une installation compl\\`ete de {{\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex} (version 2.9.4503 test\\'ee). Les macros devraient aussi fonctionner avec \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}~2014, mais \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}}~2013 ne contient pas les mises \\`a jour r\\'ecentes de police, et donc plusieurs macros de la nouvelle version de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} pourraient ne pas fonctionner avec \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}} 2013 ou ant\\'erieur. Mais cela ne devrait pas \\^etre un gros probl\\`eme puisque le disque d'installation de \\capstex~{\\caps l{\\eightrm ive}} 2013 contient une version plus ancienne de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}, qui a les anciens noms de polices. De nombreuses macros de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} utilisent la police {\\verbatim inconsolata|endverbatim} pour les caract\\`eres machine \\`a \\'ecrire. La police s'appelait {\\verbatim rm-inconsolata|endverbatim} en version 2010.1 de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}. La nouvelle version de {\\verbatim inconsolata|endverbatim}, qui a \\'et\\'e mise \\`a jour en {\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex}~2.9.4503, ne contient aucune police appel\\'ee {\\verbatim rm-inconsolata|endverbatim}. Ainsi, en {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}~(version 2013.1), nous avons choisi une autre police {\\verbatim inconsolata|endverbatim} nomm\\'ee {\\verbatim ly1-zi4r-1|endverbatim}, qui est identique, ou tout du moins, semble identique, \\`a {\\verbatim rm-inconsolata|endverbatim}. Il y a eu aussi d'autres changements dans les noms des polices, par exemple pour les polices Libertine. Si des probl\\`emes de police manquante sont rencontr\\'es en utilisant {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}, avec une installation compl\\`ete de {{\\caps m{\\eightrm i}k}\\capstex} ou de TeXLive, il est recommand\\'e d'utiliser un version soit plus ancienne, soit plus r\\'ecente de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}.\n\n\\footline{\\centerline{\\foliofont\\folio}}\n\n\nCes 45 macros de changement de police ont bien fonctionn\\'e avec plain~\\capstex, ainsi qu'avec une combinaison de plain~\\capstex\\ et d'autres formats bas\\'es sur plain~\\capstex, par exemple~  \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/amstex.html}{\\amstex} et~\\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/eplain.html}{eplain}. Les macros marchent parfaitement avec \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pdftex.html}{pdf\\capstex} et \\href{http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex}{\\capsxetex} \\'egalement. Veuillez noter que ces macros ne fonctionnent pas avec \\href{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/latex.html}{\\capslatex}, pdf\\capslatex\\hfuzz2pt, ou \\capsxelatex.\n\n\\hfuzz1pt\nLa composition d'un texte en anglais ou en fran\\c cais avec des math\\'ematiques ne devrait pas poser probl\\`eme, \\`a part peut-\\^etre si des lettres comme \\l~ sont utilis\\'ees, surtout avec des caract\\`eres en {\\slbf gras pench\\'e\\/} ou {\\caps petites capitales}. Ce sont des questions de glyphes manquants et d'encodage. Dans la police courante (Charter, romain r\\'egulier, {\\verbatim mdbchr7t|endverbatim}), {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\l|endverbatim} produit \\l, {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\slbf \\l|endverbatim} produit {\\slbf \\l}, mais {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\caps\\l|endverbatim} produit~{\\caps \\l}.\n\n\n\n\n\nLes polices sans s\\'erif ne proposent pas de caract\\`eres {\\it italiques} mais seulement {\\sl pench\\'es\\/}. Pour rendre les fichiers macros de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} plus coh\\'erents, les commandes pour l'italique et le pench\\'e (par exemple~: {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\it|endverbatim} et {\\color{brown}\\verbatim\\sl|endverbatim}), produisent des caract\\`eres {\\sl pench\\'es} dans le cas des polices sans s\\'erif et de celles ne disposant pas de glyphes distincts pour l'italique et le pench\\'e. Nous montrerons plus loin des exemples de changement des polices texte et maths de \\capstex\\ utilisant les macros de {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim}. Toutes les polices utilis\\'ees dans ces macros sont aussi list\\'ees dans ce document.\n\n\nCes macros ont \\'et\\'e con\\c{c}ues \\`a l'origine pour des utilisateurs de langue anglaise. Compte tenu des capacit\\'es de \\TeX, elles peuvent \\^etre utiles pour composer en d'autres langages \\'egalement, mais certaines polices contenues dans {\\color{brown}\\verbatim font-change|endverbatim} peuvent ne pas fonctionner pour toutes les langues (\\`a cause du rendu des accents et caract\\`eres sp\\'eciaux). Nous avons remarqu\\'e que pour ce document, qui est en langue franç\\c{c}aise, les accents ne sont pas, ou mal, plac\\'es sur certaines fontes de type pench\\'e ou machine \\`a \\'ecrire. Cela concerne les polices Arev (page 38), Epigrafica (pages 40 \\`a 41), Bera (pages 43 \\`a 45), Artemisia (page 46), et Libertine (pages 47 \\`a 49).\n\n\nNous esp\\'erons que ces macros fonctionnent bien, sans probl\\`eme de compatibilit\\'e, mais nous ne pouvons rien promettre. Il n'y a pas de garantie.

mon\nvoyage. Et il m’apparâıt, encore et encore : “Le trajet n’est-il pas\nla vraie concrétisation de l’objectif ?” De cette manière, même si\nje manque LE but, j’aurai au moins atteint UN but.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nTEX\ntypographie les documents dans les polices d’écriture Computer Modern par\ndéfaut.1 Les polices Computer Modern de Knuth sont très élégantes mais de temps\nà autre nous cherchons tous un peu de changement. Bon nombre d’entre nous\n\nsouhaiterait avoir un rendu de nos documents TEX dans d’autres fontes que Computer Modern. Au\nniveau utilisateur, il est aisé de changer la police du mode texte de TEX (autrement dit la police texte),\net il existe de nombreuses polices gratuites aux multiples styles de caractères tels que romain, gras,\nitalique, penché, gras italique, gras penché, PETITES CAPITALES, PETITES CAPITALES EN GRAS, etc. La\ndifficulté est de changer les polices mathématiques dans les documents TEX. Ceci est principalement\ndû au manque de fontes mathématiques pour TEX. Une autre raison est que changer de police en\nmode maths n’est pas aussi simple que de la changer en mode texte. Pour LATEX beaucoup de packages\npeuvent servir à changer la police (texte et math) en une commande. Mais pour TEX, je n’ai pas pu\ntrouver de manière simple pour changer la fonte dans le document, à la fois pour le texte et l’écriture\nmathématique. Le fait d’utiliser une police en mode texte et une autre en mode maths peut gâcher le\nrendu du document. Il est bien sûr désirable d’obtenir le texte et les écritures mathématiques dans\nla même police; un texte en police New Century et des maths en Computer Modern ne vont pas bien\nensemble. Certaines combinaisons, comme nous le verrons plus loin, marchent pourtant bien.\n\nEtre en mesure de choisir entre plusieurs fontes est plutôt avantageux. Les polices Computer\nModern rendent très bien sur papier, particulièrement sur les impressions jet d’encre, mais ont\nl’air relativement fines sur les écrans d’ordinateurs (LCD) et dans une moindre mesure sur les\nimpressions laser. Pour les diaporamas, la plupart des gens préfère les caractères sans sérif qui\nsont relativement plus “lourds”. L’idée de changer, en une seule commande, à la fois les polices\nmathématiques et la totalité d’une famille de polices qui comprend des styles variés comme le\ngras, l’italique, etc., a engendré la motivation nécessaire à l’accomplissement de cette tâche. Pour\nce faire, j’ai écrit 45 macros TEX qui ordonnent à TEX de typographier les documents dans les polices\nappelées par ces macros. Tout au long de ce document, l’utilisation des 45 macros mentionnées\na été exposée. Chacune de ces macros change les fontes dans le document de manière globale,\nmais peut également être utilisée localement, par exemple à l’intérieur d’un groupe. Désormais,\nun document TEX, normalement produit en Computer Modern, peut être produit en 45 autres\nvariantes. Ces fichiers macro sont facilement compréhensibles et peuvent être modifiés si besoin.\nChaque macro a différents caractères déclarés en tailles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, et 20 pt.\n\nAfin de montrer nos 45 macros de changement de fonte en action, nous avons écrit un texte\néchantillon 45 fois mais dans des polices différentes. Les polices/familles de police invoquées par\nces macros ont presque tous les glyphes contenus dans la famille Computer Modern. En général,\nces polices contiennent plus de glyphes que Computer Modern. Pour voir tous les glyphes présents\ndans une police, vous pouvez utiliser l’outil en ligne de Werner Lemberg. Dans quelques cas, par\nexemple pour la police Epigrafica normal (epigrafican8r), il manque des symboles importants\ncomme Γ and Θ. Notre macro prend cela en charge; l’utilisateur ne doit pas s’en soucier à moins\nqu’il ne demande à TEX quelque chose de très inhabituel.\n\n1 La plupart des utilisateurs (j’en fait partie) utilise les termes police, police de caractères, fonte, police d’́ecriture ou\nencore famille de polices... comme synonymes. Dans ce manuel nous avons évité ces distinctions.\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontchart?lang=en\n\n\nUtilisation\nCes macros ont été rassemblées dans un package appelé font-change qui est inclus dans les\ndistributions MiKTEX et TEX Live. Le package peut aussi être téléchargé sur CTAN. Si l’installation TEX\ncontient déjà le package font-change, il peut être utilisé dès à présent, pour mettre en forme\nn’importe quel document en police Charter par exemple. Il suffit d’écrire la commande \\input\nfont_charter dans le fichier source. Bien sûr, pour pouvoir utiliser les macros de font-change,\nl’installation TEX doit contenir les polices en question. Au cas où font-change n’est pas installé sur\nle système de l’utilisateur et celui-ci n’a pas envie de le faire, on peut télécharger le package sur\ninternet et suivre la procédure ci-dessous. Pour connâıtre toutes les options disponibles et voir les\nmacros en action, veuillez lire la suite.\n\nSupposons qu’on veuille typographier un document TEX document en police Charter. Pour\nce faire, il faut copier le fichier macro TEX font_charter.tex dans le dossier contenant le fichier\nsource TEX. Après avoir ouvert ce fichier source dans l’éditeur, il faudra y écrire la commande \\input\nfont_charter. Ceci changera la police du document en police Charter à partir de l’endroit où la\ncommande \\input font_charter a été déclarée. Il est possible de déclarer \\input font_charter\ndans un groupe fermé : ({\\input font_charter ... }) afin de changer la police de caractères en\nCharter dans tout le groupe, pourvu qu’il n’y ait pas d’autre appel à font-change dans ce groupe\nou dans un de ses sous-groupes.\n\nUne autre manière d’utiliser les fichiers macros est de les mettre dans un dossier, nommé par\nexemple “font-change”, dans un endroit du disque (par exemple à la racine de “C”), et ensuite\nd’invoquer ces fichiers dans le fichier source TEX. Pour utiliser la police Charter, il faudra écrire\nla commande suivante (qui précise juste la localisation du fichier dans l’arborescence système)\n\\input C:/font-change/font_charter. Si les fichiers macros ont été placés dans un dossier dont\nle nom contient des espaces (par exemple “font change”), il faudra alors écrire naturellement la\ncommande avec les espaces correspondants : \\input \"C:/font change/font_charter\".\n\nLe changement complet de la police se fera à la taille TEX par défaut, à savoir (10 pt), bien\nque l’on puisse utiliser les polices texte et maths à des tailles plus petites et plus grandes via de\npetites manipulations du fichier macro.\n\nLes commandes de contrôle typographique TEX basiques\n\n\\rm . . . romain\n\\it . . . italique\n\\bf . . . gras\n\\sl . . . penché\n\\tt . . . machine à écrire\n\ngardent leur signification habituelle. Tous les fichiers macro que ce PDF mentionne incluent les\ncinq options ci-dessus. De plus, la plupart des fichiers macro ont également d’autres options utiles.\nCe sont:\n\n\\itbf . . . gras italique\n\\slbf . . . gras penché\n\\caps . . . PETITES CAPITALES\n\\capsbf . . . PETITES CAPITALES EN GRAS\n\nEn mode texte, les styles mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être utilisés en taille 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n12, 14, 16, 18, et 20 pt. Ceci est obtenu en tapant la taille (nombre en anglais) en toutes lettres\nentre un backslash (\\) et le mot qui déclare le style de caractères à utiliser. Par exemple, si nous\nvoulions typographier un texte en gras à 14 pt nous n’aurions qu’à utiliser la commande de contrôle\nsuivante \\fourteenbf.\n\n2\n\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/font-change/\n\n\nExemple\nVoici un exemple de fichier source TEX :\n\n\\parindent=0pt\n\n\\input C:/font-change/font_cm\n\nVoici la {\\bf police Computer Modern}.

Les polices\nmsam et msbm de la collection AMS contiennent ces symboles. Les lettres ajourées (A,B,C,R, . . . )\nfont partie des symboles AMS. Si vous utilisez AMS-TEX, avec le style preprint (pré-impression) ou\nque la commande AMS-TEX \\UseAMSsymbols a déjà été déclarée, vous pourrez alors utiliser les\nsymboles AMS avec certaines macros font-change en déclarant \\UseAMSsymbols à nouveau après\nl’instruction d’appel à la macro. Nous allons voir un exemple de cette implémentation dans un\npetit moment.\n\nSi vous avez utilisé les instructions \\loadmsam ou \\loadmsbm de AMS-TEX, vous pourrez les\nutiliser à nouveau après avoir déclaré la macro font-change afin d’obtenir les résultats désirés.\nLa séquence de contrôle \\UseAMSsymbols reprend les instructions \\loadmsam et \\loadmsbm.\n\nPour revenir aux polices AMS par défaut (msam et msbm), il faudra entrer le fichier macro\ndefault-amssymbols.tex en écrivant la commande \\input default-amssymbols dans le fichier\nsource. Ce petit fichier contient seulement ces deux définitions :\n\n\\def\\loadmsam{\\font\\tenmsa=msam10\\font\\sevenmsa=msam7\\font\\fivemsa=msam5\n\n\\fam\\msafam\n\n\\textfont\\msafam=\\tenmsa \\scriptfont\\msafam=\\sevenmsa\n\n\\scriptscriptfont\\msafam=\\fivemsa \\global\\let\\loadmsam\\empty}%\n\n\\loadmsam\n\n%\n\n\\def\\loadmsbm{\\font\\tenmsb=msbm10\\font\\sevenmsb=msbm7\\font\\fivemsb=msbm5\n\n\\fam\\msbfam\n\n\\textfont\\msbfam=\\tenmsb \\scriptfont\\msbfam=\\sevenmsb\n\n\\scriptscriptfont\\msbfam=\\fivemsb \\global\\let\\loadmsbm\\empty}%\n\n\\loadmsbm\n\nIl sera précisé plus loin pour chaque macro du package font-change si celle-ci supporte les\nsymboles AMS. Ci-dessous la présentation de ce qui a été discuté (le caractère en rouge provient\ndes symboles AMS) :\n\n\\input amstex % Charge AmSTeX\n\n\\UseAMSsymbols % Invoque les symboles AMS\n\n$$f:{\\color{red}\\Bbb R}ˆ3\\to R$$\n\n\\input font_kp % Invoque Kp-Fonts\n\n\\UseAMSsymbols % Utilise jkpsya et jkpsyb de Kp-Fonts \\‘a la place de msam et msbm\n\ndes polices AMS\n\n$$f:{\\color{red}\\Bbb R}\\to R$$\n\n\\input default-amssymbols % Revient au d\\’efaut\n\n$$f:{\\color{red}\\Bbb R}ˆ3\\to R$$\n\n4\n\n\n\nproduit après compilation :\n\nf : R3 → R\n\nf : R3 → R\n\nf : R3 → R\n\nGraisses disponibles\nCertaines macros de changement de police d’écriture du package font-change proposent des\ngraisses légères, moyennes et grasses. De nombreuses familles de police offrent la variante grasse\ndes fontes mathématiques, mais nous n’avons pas toujours inclus certaines variantes qui ne four-\nnissaient pas une police assez épaisse pour rendre le contraste. En tapant tout le texte en gras, si à\ncertains endroits nous voulons mettre encore plus de gras, nous serons coincés. La philosophie de\nfont-change dit que pour mettre en gras tout le texte et les maths, il faut trouver une police plus\népaisse parmi la famille de polices utilisée, encore plus grasse que le gras habituel. Les familles de\nfontes Kp-Fonts, Antykwa Toruńska, Iwona, et Kurier incluent de telles épaisseurs et font partie\nde font-change. Par exemple, la macro font_kurier-bold, qui utilise un style gras pour sa police\nnormale (en maths et texte), prend une police poids lourd pour le style gras.\n\nMises à jour et avertissement\nLes polices utilisées dans ces 45 macros sont incluses dans les distributions MiKTEX et TEX Live. Toutes\nces macros devraient marcher sans problème avec une installation complète de MiKTEX (version\n2.9.4503 testée). Les macros devraient aussi fonctionner avec TEX Live 2014, mais TEX Live 2013\nne contient pas les mises à jour récentes de police, et donc plusieurs macros de la nouvelle\nversion de font-change pourraient ne pas fonctionner avec TEX Live 2013 ou antérieur. Mais cela\nne devrait pas être un gros problème puisque le disque d’installation de TEX Live 2013 contient une\nversion plus ancienne de font-change, qui a les anciens noms de polices. De nombreuses macros\nde font-change utilisent la police inconsolata pour les caractères machine à écrire. La police\ns’appelait rm-inconsolata en version 2010.1 de font-change. La nouvelle version de inconsolata,\nqui a été mise à jour en MiKTEX 2.9.4503, ne contient aucune police appelée rm-inconsolata.\nAinsi, en font-change (version 2013.1), nous avons choisi une autre police inconsolata nommée\nly1-zi4r-1, qui est identique, ou tout du moins, semble identique, à rm-inconsolata. Il y a eu\naussi d’autres changements dans les noms des polices, par exemple pour les polices Libertine. Si\ndes problèmes de police manquante sont rencontrés en utilisant font-change, avec une installation\ncomplète de MiKTEX ou de TeXLive, il est recommandé d’utiliser un version soit plus ancienne, soit\nplus récente de font-change.\n\nCes 45 macros de changement de police ont bien fonctionné avec plain TEX, ainsi qu’avec une\ncombinaison de plain TEX et d’autres formats basés sur plain TEX, par exemple AMS-TEX et eplain.\nLes macros marchent parfaitement avec pdfTEX et X ETEX également. Veuillez noter que ces macros\nne fonctionnent pas avec LATEX, pdfLATEX, ou X ELATEX.\n\n5\n\nhttp://miktex.org/\nhttp://www.tug.org/texlive/\nhttp://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/amstex.html\nhttp://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/eplain.html\nhttp://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pdftex.html\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex\nhttp://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/latex.html\n\n\nLa composition d’un texte en anglais ou en français avec des mathématiques ne devrait pas\nposer problème, à part peut-être si des lettres comme ł sont utilisées, surtout avec des caractères\nen gras penché ou PETITES CAPITALES. Ce sont des questions de glyphes manquants et d’encodage.\nDans la police courante (Charter, romain régulier, mdbchr7t), \\l produit ł, \\slbf \\l produit ł, mais\n\\caps\\l produit L.\n\nLes polices sans sérif ne proposent pas de caractères italiques mais seulement penchés. Pour\nrendre les fichiers macros de font-change plus cohérents, les commandes pour l’italique et le\npenché (par exemple : \\it et \\sl), produisent des caractères penchés dans le cas des polices sans\nsérif et de celles ne disposant pas de glyphes distincts pour l’italique et le penché. Nous montrerons\nplus loin des exemples de changement des polices texte et maths de TEX utilisant les macros de\nfont-change. Toutes les polices utilisées dans ces macros sont aussi listées dans ce document.\n\nCes macros ont été conçues à l’origine pour des utilisateurs de langue anglaise. Compte tenu\ndes capacités de TEX, elles peuvent être utiles pour composer en d’autres langages également,\nmais certaines polices contenues dans font-change peuvent ne pas fonctionner pour toutes les\nlangues (à cause du rendu des accents et caractères spéciaux). Nous avons remarqué que pour ce\ndocument, qui est en langue française, les accents ne sont pas, ou mal, placés sur certaines fontes\nde type penché ou machine à écrire. Cela concerne les polices Arev (page 38), Epigrafica (pages\n40 à 41), Bera (pages 43 à 45), Artemisia (page 46), et Libertine (pages 47 à 49).\n\nNous espérons que ces macros fonctionnent bien, sans problème de compatibilité, mais nous\nne pouvons rien promettre. Il n’y a pas de garantie.
